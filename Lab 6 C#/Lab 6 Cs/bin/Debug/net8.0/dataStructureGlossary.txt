Data Structure: arrays
What it's used for: Ordered collections of elements of the same data type, accessed by index.

Data Structure: linked lists
What it's used for: Sequences of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

Data Structure: stacks
What it's used for: Follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one removed.

Data Structure: queues
What it's used for: Follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one removed.

Data Structure: trees
What it's used for: Hierarchical structures consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a root node and child nodes. Binary trees are a specific type where each node has at most two children.

Data Structure: graphs
What it's used for: Collections of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, representing relationships between data.

Data Structure: heaps
What it's used for: Tree-based structures that satisfy the heap property, where the value of each node is greater than or equal to (or less equal to) the value of its children.

Data Structure: hash tables
What it's used for: Store key-value pairs, using a hash function to compute the index for each key.
